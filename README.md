Need Pytorch to run these codes

For method_1

  Run sqlite_operator.py to create samples from a Gaussian mixture model distribution and a uniform distribution 

  Run Distr_PrbDens_train.py to build and train the neural network

  Run PrbDens_show.py to show the result
  
For method_2
  
  Run build_sample_sets.py to create samples from a Gaussian mixture model distribution and a uniform distribution 

  Run PrbDens_train.py to build and train the neural network

  Run PrbDens_show.py to show the result
